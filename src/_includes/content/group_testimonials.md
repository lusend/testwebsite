I truly believe that God gives us what we need when we need it the most. The Christian development and fellowship during this trip was exactly what I needed. This was a humbling experience for me, and it taught me the importance of faithfulness, forgiveness, and family. What an experience!

I am a 53 year-old student, and to say that my trip to Ecuador was life-changing should say it all. The lessons were outstanding, but the relationships I formed in the process added a missing ingredient that my online education was missing.

Having the opportunity to go on an LU Send trip to Rwanda was one of the best experiences of my life. I loved learning about another culture and interacting with the people there. It has given me a fresh perspective on life that no picture could ever give.

I learned so much more about Israel from being there for 10 days than I could have if I had read about Israel for a whole month. In addition, the relationships that I developed over the course of my LU Send trip are ones that I will treasure for a lifetime!

The opportunity for growth and community with other likeminded individuals was lifechanging and altered my behavior when I got back onto campus. The people of Rwanda showed me more about what it means to be a follower of God than I had seen in my life before, my whole world and future changed forever.
