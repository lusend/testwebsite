As faculty, your involvement is integral in equipping Liberty students to be fully prepared to meet their futures in a globalizing marketplace. LU Send works with you to create cross-cultural opportunities that contribute to your students’ development as lifelong learners and Champions for Christ, wherever their journey takes them.

1. The Trip Coordinator assigned to your trip will meet with you to assess and finalize the specific logistical needs of your trip. This includes:
   - Trip itinerary
   - Budget & payment plan options
   - Flights & ground transportation
   - Participant training requirements
   - Promotion & recruiting strategies
   - Application personalization
   - Academic options & course registration strategy
   - Miscellaneous needs (passports/visas, insurance, background checks, specific vendor requirements, etc.)
2. The faculty/staff leader and the appropriate LU Send individuals will sign the Trip Agreement outlining the responsibilities of all involved parties.
3. After the Trip Agreement has been signed, promotion & recruiting for the trip can begin. Students will also be able to apply for the trip at this point.

Any Faculty member participating in international group travel opportunities **that are not related to the University** but which do have Liberty University students attending (i.e. church mission trips) must be disclosed to LU Send no later than 3 weeks before travel. This short disclosure form can be found through the Faculty/Staff Resources Gateway on our website. In addition to registration, none of these international opportunities are to be presented or marketed to Liberty University students on campus without express written permission from LU Send.
