Whenever a faculty or staff member travels overseas for university purposes, they must fill out a travel registration form. This is NOT an approval to travel. That is given within each department. This is a notification that the travel is happening, and allows LU Send to enroll each traveler into the University’s emergency management system, and purchase the required International Health & Travel insurance that is needed for university students and employees to travel overseas. Travel locations will also be reviewed by Liberty University’s Global Travel Advisory Committee to ensure there are not travel advisory or insurance exclusions. This travel registration form is required to be filled out no later than 4 weeks prior to the travel departure date to give us time to purchase the required insurance. Once the insurance has been purchased from the indicated budget code, your individual insurance card will be uploaded to your Travel Registration form under the “Documents” tab before the date of departure.

Common forms of international travel among faculty and staff are (but are not limited to) recruitment, OSPR grants, research, conferences, etc. This faculty/staff travel registration form is NOT used for students traveling internationally. There are separate forms for students to use that require the University’s assumption of risk forms. Please find the section below that best fits your travel!
