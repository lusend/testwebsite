# Billing & Payments

![Filler Header Image](https://liberty-sa.terradotta.com/_customtags/ct_Image.cfm?Image_ID=35671){.header}

Students participating in a signature study abroad program, custom study abroad program, or international internship will pay their program fee, applicable tuition, and the LU Send study abroad or international internship fee through Financial Check-In the semester prior to travel.

Students may be required to pay their program directly for: 

-	Application Fee
-	Confirmation Deposit
-	Additional Excursions

Students are responsible for booking and paying for their roundtrip airfare to all programs and communicating their itinerary to LU Send. 

## Independent Internship

If a student chooses to participate in an internship that is not through an approved LU Send program, it is considered an independent international internship. If a student chooses to participate in an independent internship, students are responsible for paying their organization directly. LU Send does not recommend students participate in independent internships as they are not vetted by LU Send. For questions about using outside scholarships, loans, and grants to fund an independent internship, please contact [financialaid@liberty.edu](mailto:financialaid@liberty.edu).

If the student is pursuing an independent internship, they will be responsible for paying the internship organization directly for all program costs. Please coordinate with the organization regarding payment due dates and other financial obligations. The LU Send fee will still be placed on the student's account to be paid through Financial Check-In, and students are still required to pay tuition for any corresponding classes (if the internship is being completed for Liberty credit). Students must complete Financial Check-In to begin making payments.

NOTE: When completing Financial Check-In, students may be prompted to make one full payment. If needed, please contact Student Accounts at [studentaccounts@liberty.edu](mailo:studentaccounts@liberty.edu) to set up a payment plan.

# Financial Aid

![Filler Header Image](https://liberty-sa.terradotta.com/_customtags/ct_Image.cfm?Image_ID=35675){.header}

## Signature Programs

Students are allowed to utilize their Liberty scholarships and federal financial aid to finance their signature study abroad experience while receiving credit directly from Liberty University. In these programs, students pay a set program fee based on location, Liberty University tuition, and the LU Send study abroad fee.

## Custom Programs

Students are allowed to utilize their federal and outside financial aid to finance their custom study abroad experience. In these programs, students pay a program fee set by the partner organization and the LU Send study abroad fee. 

## International Internships

Students have to pay a program fee set by the partner organization, Liberty tuition (if receiving credit), and the LU Send internship fee. 

**Please note that Liberty-awarded aid cannot be applied to independent internships. Once all eligible aid has been applied to a student's account, any remaining balance is the student's responsibility.** 

**For all other questions about using outside scholarships, loans, and grants to fund an independent internship, please contact [financialaid@liberty.edu](mailto:financialaid@liberty.edu)**

# Consortium Agreement

![Filler Header Image](https://liberty-sa.terradotta.com/_customtags/ct_Image.cfm?Image_ID=35677){.header}

Consortium agreements are specific to students participating in Custom Study Abroad programs. This form allows students to use federal financial aid, scholarships, and loans to finance their study abroad experience. Students can expect to receive this form from the Financial Aid Office once their Course Approval Form has been finalized with the Registrar's Office.

Students who do not wish to use their financial aid to finance their custom study abroad program are **_not required_** to complete this agreement. 

# Registration & Enrollment

![Filler Header Image](https://liberty-sa.terradotta.com/_customtags/ct_Image.cfm?Image_ID=35691){.header}

Residential students **must** maintain full-time student status while studying abroad by taking the equivalent of at least 12 U.S. credits (for fall and spring semesters). Students may take more than 12 credits, but at least 12 credits **must** satisfy the requirements of their Degree Completion Plan (DCP). 

## Signature Programs

Students will take courses in person with their study abroad program; however, they will be registered in special sections of Liberty courses to receive credit directly from Liberty. If students do not meet the prerequisites for the courses they wish to take, they must submit a prerequisite override to receive approval. For questions regarding prerequisites of courses, please consult the [Registrar's Office](https://www.liberty.edu/registrar/) webpage.

## Custom Programs

Students will take courses in person with their host university or study center. Students will complete a Course Approval Form as part of the application process with LU Send to receive preapproval for transfer credit through their program.

LU Send will facilitate seeking approval for transfer credit in conjunction with each academic department. Once all courses have been reviewed, the Registrar's Office will review and certify which courses are approved for the student to take abroad and transfer back to Liberty.


## International Internships

Students completing an internship for credit must complete the Internship Agreement Form to be enrolled in the corresponding internship course(s) for their Degree Completion Plan. Students will complete the Internship Agreement Form as part of the application process with LU Send. Students will need to obtain signatures from their in-country site supervisor and academic department. 

NOTE: **There is no credit minimum for students participating in a Summer program**  
NOTE: **Online students are not held to the 12 credit minimum for Spring and Fall semesters.**

# Courses, Credits, & Grades

![Filler Header Image](https://liberty-sa.terradotta.com/_customtags/ct_Image.cfm?Image_ID=35693){.header}

Students participating in a signature study abroad program will receive a letter grade on their Degree Completion Plan at the end of each semester, which will be calculated into their overall GPA.

Students participating in a custom study abroad program will have an official transcript sent to Liberty University from their host program to be evaluated for transfer credit. Only courses in which students earn a grade equivalent of C or higher are eligible to be evaluated for transfer credit by Liberty University. These grades will reflect Pass or Fail on their degree plan and will not be calculated into their overall GPA.

Please note that credit systems vary throughout the world, and it is very important that you understand how the credit system at your host institution equates to the credit system at Liberty University. 

For Liberty University's full transfer policy, please refer to the [Registrar's Office](https://www.liberty.edu/registrar/course-transfer-equivalency/) webpage on academic policies.

# Housing at Liberty University

![Filler Header Image](https://liberty-sa.terradotta.com/_customtags/ct_Image.cfm?Image_ID=35684){.header}

Students who will be abroad during any fall or spring semester will need to submit a request for off-campus approval with Residence Life. Instructions to request this approval are provided in their LU Send application. Students are responsible for confirming their housing selection with Residence Life by completing FCI for the semester immediately following their semester abroad. Please note that students are still responsible for adhering to the FCI deadline for each semester, including while they are abroad.

# Risk Management

![Filler Header Image](https://liberty-sa.terradotta.com/_customtags/ct_Image.cfm?Image_ID=35686){.header}

LU Send works with Risk Management, LUPD (Liberty University Police Department), and Student Health Services to assess the security and health conditions of all programs and host countries around the world. 

LU Send receives real-time reports of global events and continuously monitors travel reports and advisories. LU Send takes into consideration recommendations issued by the U.S. Department of State, Center for Disease Control, and Alert Traveler. Please know that students may be advised against travel to certain countries or locations at any point in their planning due to current safety and risk factors in their host country.
